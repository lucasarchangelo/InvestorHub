# Hackathon Pitch Guide 🚀  

A great hackathon pitch is **clear, concise, and compelling**. Follow this structure to stand out:  

## **1. Hook (10-15 sec)**  
- Start with a **strong problem statement** or surprising stat.  
  *Example:*  
  > "Did you know 1 in 3 people struggle with X? Today, we’re solving that with [Product Name]."  

## **2. Solution (20-30 sec)**  
- Explain **what your hack does** in simple terms.  
- Highlight the **unique twist** (AI, automation, etc.).  
  *Example:*  
  > "Our app uses real-time AI to detect fraud in banking transactions—cutting losses by 40%."  

## **3. Demo (30-45 sec)**  
- **Show, don’t just tell!** Walk through key features with a live demo or screens.  
- Focus on **user flow** (e.g., "With one click, users can…").  

## **4. Tech Stack (10-15 sec)**  
- Name the **core technologies** (e.g., "Built with React, Flask, and OpenAI’s API").  
- Bonus: Mention **technical hurdles** you overcame.  

## **5. Impact (10-15 sec)**  
- Who benefits? Scale the potential.  
  *Example:*  
  > "This could help 50M small businesses save time on invoicing."  

## **6. Call to Action (5-10 sec)**  
- End with **next steps** or ask for support.  
  *Example:*  
  > "We’re launching next month—try our beta at X.com!"
