She has a basic brokerage account but has never invested in crypto due to perceived risks.
- **Needs:** Clear, jargon-free explanations of crypto concepts, a guided onboarding process to reduce intimidation, low-risk investment options to start, transparency on all fees, and educational resources to build confidence.
- **Motivations:** Wants to explore new financial trends, seeks better returns than her savings account (2–4% APY), and desires financial independence.
- **Pain Points:** Overwhelmed by crypto terminology (e.g., "gas fees", "impermanent loss"), fears losing money due to scams or volatility, unsure how to start investing, and concerned about hidden costs.
